# <img src="Transgemi.ico" alt="Transgemi Icon" width="48"> Transgemi - Screen Translator

A simple, on-the-fly screen translator that uses Windows' built-in OCR and Google's Gemini AI to translate text from a selected area of your screen.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed and the required libraries. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Application
There are two ways to run the application:

1.  **Directly with Python (Recommended for developers):**
    `python scrtrans_t.py`

2.  **Using the VBScript (For ease of use):**
    Double-click the `run_transgemi.vbs` file. This script runs the Python application in the background without opening a console window.

### Hotkeys
-   **`Alt + Q`**: Select a new area on the screen to translate.
-   **`~`** (Tilde key): Toggle live translation on or off for the selected area.
-   **`+` / `-`**: Increase or decrease the font size of the translated text.
-   **`Alt + T`**: Show or hide the translation window.
-   **`Esc`**: Close the application.

## How It Works
The tool captures the selected screen region, sends it to the Gemini AI for translation, and displays the result in a transparent, always-on-top window. It rotates through different Gemini models to manage API rate limits and caches results to improve performance.
